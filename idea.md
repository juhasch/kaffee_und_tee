# Kaffe und Tee

## Idea

This app loads all recipes from the Website 
https://www.swr.de/video/sendungen-a-z/kaffee-oder-tee/rezepte/rezeptearchiv-100.html and displays them as a list.

If you click on one of the recipes, you get an image of the recipe and the list of ingredients.

If you click on the image of the recipe, you get the original webpage.

This app must be extremely simple and easy to use. It is for elderly people.

Overall, there are only three pages:
1. The starting page with an overview of recipes
2. The recipe page with an image of the recipe and the ingredients
3. A video page showing the video of the recipe

On the bottom of the screen there are two buttons:
1. A "home" button, that brings you back to the starting page
2. A "back" button, that brings you back to the previous page

## Realization

* This is a project for an Android tablet.
* Read the provided website, parse it and create the starting page
* Remove all unnecessary distractions
* Remember, this is for elderly people, so don't use small fonts or icons, everything should be large enough to read comfortably.
